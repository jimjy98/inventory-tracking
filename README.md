Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge 2022 (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9LZ_kZBUbg-O2MhZVVSqTmvDko5IJWHtuFmIu_Xg1A/edit)

## Tech stack

I have used React for the frontend, and Nestjs with TypeORM for the backend, with a PgSQL database engine. I know it is very hectic and tedious to set it up, so I decided to learn and use Docker (for the first time) to make it easier to set up.
